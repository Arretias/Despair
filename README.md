# Despair
Text-Based Game written in Python 3.7 -- 

Initially, 9 rooms will be the basis for the game. The user will begin their adventure in the central room, with only 1 adjacent room being unlocked, as the others require keys. These keys will be obtained throughout the adventure and opportunities for an early death in-game will be there to create a challenge.

The rooms being used in the game will be given names and a key to represent each within a Python Dictionary, and the title of each room will be made clear to the user to prevent confusion for players.

Elements of the game such as opening/closing doors and moving rooms will provide simple and safe options for the user to move freely in the in-game world, however some options that are riskier may provide reward, but may also present risk in the form of random rolls in a D&D style, in which riskier options are not compulsory but may tempt the user.

Players will also have an inventory, stored in a list which will be volatile and changing during gameplay, with certain items (such as the keys aforementioned) being more obvious than others, which may not be found, but will make certain tasks easier and provide advantages to the user.
